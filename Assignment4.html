    <!-- 1.	Create an HTML page with two buttons that argue with each other.
         When one button is clicked, the text "I'm right" should be placed next to it. When the other button is clicked, 
         the text is replaced with, "No, I'm right!" -->

         <p></p>
         <button class="first">first</button>
         <button class="second">second</button>
         <br/>
<!-- 2.	Create an HTML page with a large element on the page that says "Don't hover over me" 
    inside of it. When you hover over the element, send an alert to the user that says, 
    "Hey, I told you not to hover over me! -->

    <div class="hover">
        <p>Don't hover over me</p>
    </div>

    <!-- 3.	Create an HTML page with a form. It should include inputs for a username, 
        email, and password. Also a submit button. -->

    <!-- <form action=""> -->
        <h1>welcome</h1>
        <input type="text" class = "username" value="enter your username">
        <input type="password" class = "password">
        <button class = "Login">Login</button>
    <!-- </form> -->

    <!-- 6.	BONUS: Create an HTML page with a form that asks the user to input the value of a sphere's radius. 
        Write Javascript that gives them back the volume of the sphere. (There are many different ways to execute this. 
        You can give the user information back in another input box on the page, as an alert, or any other way you can think of. 
        You can look up how to use the Javascript Math object to simplify your calculations.) -->
        <h1 class = "text">input the value of a sphere's radius</h1>
        <input type="radius" class = "radius">
        <button class = "calculate">calculate</button>
